# Introduction to DevOps: Automate Everything to Focus on What Really Matters
## Learning Objectives
This project aims at showing use cases where a DevOps mindset is bringing value to a software project by automating it, which decreases the amount of manual work and increases the development speed. It focuses on why automation is useful and helps speeding a development lifecycle.

After this project, you should be able to:

* Understand the value of automating tedious tasks
* Define a development lifecycle
* Automate shell-like tasks with Make, and/or shell script
* Be aware of tools dependencies and the value of reproducing environment
* Build static HTML website from Markdown code using Go-Hug

# Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
## Learning Objectives
This project aims at practicing with Continuous Integration (CI) / Delivery (CD) / Deployment to understand the differences, the goals and the value.

After this project, you should be able to:

* Implement Continuous Integration workflows using GitHub Actions
* Tell if a given GitHub Action’s workflow is about Continuous Integration (CI), or Continuous Delivery (CD) or Continuous Deployment (skill of context analysis)
* Understand the challenges of build reproductibility, through management of build dependencies using APT packages, NPM, Python3’s pip, and direct binary downloads.
* Build collaboratively a Software Delivery Pipeline and produce released artifacts, including documenting the changes and the usage
* Continuously deploy a static web site to Netlify


# Write a Makefile to implement these steps for the actual Go-Hugo website’s source code.

## Learning Objectives

This project aims at understanding the benefits of Docker by going over problems it solves.

After this project, you should be able to:

* Learn to create, deploy, and run applications via Docker containers.
* Build and test software as part of a CI/CD pipeline, using Docker.
